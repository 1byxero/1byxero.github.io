I am Anuj Godase, a graduate student pursuing Master's degree in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington. I am interested in Software development, machine learning and AI.

I work as a research assistant for [Dr. Ariful Azad](https://arifulazad.com/) with research focusing on understanding graph parameters that affect the learning of graph based deep learning algorithms. During the summer'20, I worked as research asssitant at [IU CVLab](vision.soic.indiana.edu/) on understanding and improving depth estimation algorithms under the guidance of [Dr. David Crandall](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/djcran/)

I have more than two years of industry experience during which I primarily worked in startups. My work involved backend development, data engineering and full stack development. The last company I worked for was a fintech startup where products I contributed to affected 7+ Million users on daily basis.

I am currently looking for full time opportunities in software developement, cloud, machine learning and AI!

I am always excited to talk and learn about products working at global scale, tech invovations and AI. My email is [abgodase@iu.edu](mailto:abgodase@iu.edu). More contact info can be found on left side of this page!
