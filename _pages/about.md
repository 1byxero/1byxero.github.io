I am Anuj Godase, a graduate student pursuing master's degree in computer science at Indiana University Bloomington. I am interested in software development, machine learning and AI.

**I am currently looking for full time opportunities starting June 2021 in software developement, cloud, machine learning and AI.**

I have more than two years of industry experience. My work focused on backend development, data engineering and full stack development. The last company I worked for was a fintech startup where products I contributed to were used by 7 Million+ users on daily basis.

I actively contribute to open source and its highlight is my contribution to [PIP - the python package installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

I also have some experience conducting research in the domain of deep learning and AI. The details can be found on the [research section](/research/) of this website.
